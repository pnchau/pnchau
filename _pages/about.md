Hi, my name is Phat and I am 23 years old and am currently a senior at the University of Houston. I am studying Computer Science and am looking to graduate in May this year. I am currently looking for an internship or job this summer to further develope my skills as a software engineer. I do have some experience in data science and natural language processing from some projects but have no current work experience.
